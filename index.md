## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="henry.jpg">

Hi! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I am researching self-driving vehicles at the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research [WatCAR](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-automotive-research/).

Before coming to Waterloo, I worked as an process instrumentation and control engineer for TC Energy and as an system integration & embedded software intern for General Electric Canada Inc, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.


## Research Interest

* Autonomous vehicle pedestrian interaction
* Pedestrian behaviour modeling and prediction
* Object detection and vehicle localization
* Safe reinforcement learning
* A.I. trust and social impact
